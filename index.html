        Joint Managing Trustee : Janab P.V. Mohamed Hariff</b></br>
        <br>
        
        This trust was constituted by the highly philanthropic minded persons with the due involvement of the persons from the adjacent towns and cities apart from the active participation of many rich philanthropists from the neighbouring state of kerala. This is concentrating on providing education and also intends to serve in the field of medicine.<br>
        <br>
        Recognising the importance of higher education, the Trust sent up a proposal to the Government of Tamilnadu and Bharathiar University, Coimbatore to establish and run an Arts and Science College at Coimbatore and then proceed to fulfill the norms stipulated by the Govt. and the University. As per G.O. No.: 171 dt.27-8-98 and of the University Letter No. 14421/A1/97 dt.27/8/98, the college came into being on 31st August '98, offering Undergraduate Degree Courses. We are happy that the College has notched a place for itself in a short span of time among the students interested in learning and pursuing higher morals & social values.<br>
        <br>
        
        English will be the medium of instruction. Tamil is offered under Part-I, if adequate students are available the college will arrange coaching for Hindi, Malayalam, Arabic and Urudu. They have to pay language exemption fee to the University.

          "Knowledge is power and library is the powerhouse". Books are the best teachers and counselors. To synchronize theory and practice, the journals, magazines and newspapers are very helpful. A Library is a collection of information, resources and services, organized for use, and maintained by a responsible body. Libraries inform the public of what materials are available in their collections and how to access that information. A modern Library provides educational resources to students and teachers through publications and other electronic media.
